# CIRCULATE-WebApps
R scripts for the shinyapps on laboratory analysis and sensors based on the CIRCULATE Citizen Science project funded by the Ajuntament de Barcelona in collaboration with La Caixa Foundation.

There are two folders with the following content:

- **Laboratory Shinyapp**: Contains R scripts for the shinyapp based on the results from laboratory analysis, including urine samples, silicone wristbands and silicone patches.
- **Sensor Shinyapp**: Contains R scripts for the shinyapp based on the results from sensors, including the Atmotubes and Smart Citizen Kits (SCK).
